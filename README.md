# Tableau
I know tooltip, labels, color and filters along with calculated & parameter field. For my homework, I created bar graph to showcase top 20 drugs in the US based on drug claim, and drug cost. I created a map using label for amount of drug based on states and only showing top 5 states in their respective name. 
For my project, I created a circle graph to show the top trending videos of youtube in 2018. I taken the data from kaggle, and filter out any music video. By doing so, I was able to see what's the average income for a youtube based on ads and content.

I uploaded these pdf to showcase my ability to visualize.
